You will be building a basic fintech  API with the following User stories.

- Users can create an account(Basic Information- email, name, password)
- User can fund their Account with a Card or Bank Transfer.
- Users can send money to another User using their email.
- Users can only send money to their Beneficiaries.
- Use webhook only to confirm if transfer or funding is successful (check out Ngrok to help out).
- Writing tests for this is a plus
- Please use MySQL for this test, any Node framework can be used
- Knowledge of Typescript is a huge plus

Kindly expose APIs to enable these activities to be carried out. You can abstract all external API calls to payment providers for **Funding Accounts** and **Sending money**  

NB: Use Paystack Flutterwave or Monnify for external APIs
